<p><strong>Salima Al-Farisi</strong></p>
<p>10.10.1882 - 16.2.1910</p>
<p>Mecca, Ottoman Empire (modern-day Saudi Arabia)</p>
<p>Salima Al-Farisi was born in the flourishing city of Mecca, in the then Ottoman Empire, on the 10th of October, 1882. She was the only child of her parents, both traders with roots deeply connected to the bustling marketplace. Raised amidst the scent of spices, vibrant textiles, and the constant hum of haggling voices, she grew up with a strong sense of humble pride towards her middle-class family and fellow community members.</p>
<p>Salima took immense pride in her diverse cultural heritage which was deeply encompassed by the Islamic faith. The faith imbued her values, her way of life, and her perception of the world around her. From a young age, Salima had a fond reverence for the Grand Mosque, the centre of spiritual life in Mecca. </p>
<p>In 1898, at the age of sixteen, Salima married Ahmed Al-Khouri, a young carpet merchant from her community. As a housewife, she was involved in the upbringing of the local children and the management of her familial house. Her devotion to her faith and her attention to her responsibilities conveyed a strong sense of integrity and diligence, values commonly upheld by the women of her time and community. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in 1910, she suffered complications during childbirth which led to her sudden demise at the young age of 27, leaving behind her husband, Ahmed Al-Khouri.</p>
