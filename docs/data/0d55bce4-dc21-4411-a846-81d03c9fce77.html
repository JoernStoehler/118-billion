<p><strong>Shaniya</strong></p>
<p>9768 BC - 9756 BC</p>
<p>Sudan region of Northern Africa</p>
<p>Shaniya was born in 9768 BC in what is now known today as the Sudan region of Northern Africa. She was the daughter of Kushitic hunters that belonged to the Afro-Asiatic group, who lived by hunting game and gathering food from the land.</p>
<p>At an early age, Shaniya showed a keen eye for collecting fruits, roots, and herbs, providing her family with much needed sustenance in this prehistoric age. Despite her age, she was tenacious, known to wander beyond the ordinary boundaries of their region to find substantial food sources - a task generally assumed by adults. She unfolded her duty as a gatherer with deep knowledge of the season and locations of the harvest that ensured their survival.</p>
<p>Shaniya and her family held a strong belief in animism, a belief system where they envisaged a spirit or force beyond the physical world, and integrated it into their daily life. They attributed special spirits to outstanding natural features, such as mountains, trees, and rivers. Shaniyaâ€™s favourite spirit was embodied by the tallest acacia tree in their region, which she believed protected her during her gathering expeditions.</p>
<p>She died at the age of 12 from an infectious disease that, despite her parents attempts to sustain her with herbs, ended her short life. Unmarried, and a cherished part of her nuclear family, her death was a painful blow to her closely knit circle.</p>
