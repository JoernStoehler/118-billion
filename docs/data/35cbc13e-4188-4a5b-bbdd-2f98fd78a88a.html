<p><strong>Enlil-nadin</strong></p>
<p>3014 BC - 2994 BC</p>
<p>Nippur, Sumer</p>
<p>Enlil-nadin was born in 3014 BC in the Sumerian city of Nippur. The oldest of five siblings, he was a son of two slave laborers. Despite his low social status, Enlil-nadin held firm to his faith in Sumerian paganism, hoping for ascension from his mortal hardships.</p>
<p>Life in Nippur was grueling for Enlil-nadin, and so he learned his parentâ€™s trade early on. His callused hands were ever stained with clay and dust, forever shaping bricks for the city walls and the grand ziggurats.</p>
<p>Enlil-nadin's sixth summer was marked by the tragic loss of his family to malnutrition and strain from work. From then on, the city and its harsh realities were his only kin. Living conditions were harsh, yet he became stronger, surviving day by day.</p>
<p>At 15, Enlil-nadin was noticed by a high-ranking official who admired his tenacity. The official, albeit exploiting his free labor, gave him a certain level of protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a dysentery outbreak in 2994 BC ended his brief existence at 20. He worked until his last breath, leaving this mortal plane single and childless, bearing the weight of life with the same resilience he demonstrated since childhood.</p>
