<p><strong>Aurelia</strong></p>
<p>7.12.354 AD - 25.6.394 AD</p>
<p>Rural Outskirts of Alexandria, Egypt</p>
<p>Aurelia was born in 354 AD in the rural outskirts of the once thriving metropolis of Alexandria, Egypt. The child of freemans, she was the youngest daughter of a tradesman father and a mother who managed their small farmstead. Raised in a world heavily influenced by the Roman Empire's diminishing grasp, Aurelia lived her life amid constant societal flux.</p>
<p>From an early age, Aurelia was put to work assisting in the family's food processing trade. Involved in preparing and preserving the fruits of their farm, she spent countless hours under the Mediterranean sun drying grapes, olives, and figs—an occupation that continued into her adulthood. Famous for her hard work and dedication, her processed foods became one of the most sought-after in local markets.</p>
<p>In 372 AD, Aurelia married a fellow tradesperson, Marcus, a woodworker. They shared common beliefs—both were followers of Arianism, a branch of Christianity that was popular but controversial in their era. Together they navigated through the pros and cons of their faith, continually reinforcing their bond in the process.</p>
<p>Aurelia and Marcus were blessed with three children—two sons and a daughter. Life was hard, but the couple managed to give their offspring a better life than what they had experienced. They dreamed of their children growing up to hold more respectable occupations, perhaps becoming scholars, merchants, or priests.</p>
<p>Sadly, in 394 AD, at the age of 40, Aurelia's life was cut short by a rampant bout of what is now believed to have been dysentery. Despite the advancements in medical knowledge of Alexandria's urban centre, Aurelia's rural lifestyle meant she had no access to such developments. Her death was a devastating blow to her loved ones and community.</p>
