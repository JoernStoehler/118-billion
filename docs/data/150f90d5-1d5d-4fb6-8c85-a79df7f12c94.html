<p><strong>Bodhan</strong></p>
<p>1.1.367 AD - 1.1.396 AD</p>
<p>A small village in Indian Subcontinent</p>
<p>Bodhan was born in the year 367 AD in a small and humble village in the Indian subcontinent. His family, members of the Sudra caste, lived a life of labor, serving the more prosperous households in the community. Bodhan was no exception. His life was shaped by the confines of his birth and the socioeconomic structures that governed society, but his spirit remained unbroken under the weight of hardship.</p>
<p>Clothed in simple garments of dyed cotton, akin to other folks of his social standing, Bodhan was a servant in the household of a wealthy landowner. With dutiful acceptance of his lot in life, he carried out his duties diligently. Despite the challenging circumstances, he found comfort in the teachings of Buddha, which he learnt from the begging monks who would often visit their village. His faith inspired him with a sense of peace and tranquility, providing him solace from the harsh realities of his life.</p>
<p>When Bodhan turned 20, he wed Devi, a girl from a neighbouring village, in a simple ceremony that bore witness to their union. Life swiftly moved on, and they were soon blessed with a son, who was named Samak. As a family, they mirrored the structure of most families in their society - living in joint households with various relatives contributing to the shared livelihood.</p>
<p>Bodhan's life, however, was not long. At the age of 29, he tragically succumbed to an infectious disease that swept across the village, leaving a trail of sorrow in its wake. His death in 396 AD marked the end of a humble life lived within the confines of time, societal structures, and nature's dictates.</p>
